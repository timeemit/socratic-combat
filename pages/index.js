    <Land title="Socratic Combat" className="pure-g">
      <p className="pure-u-1">Socratic Combat is an initiaive to scale the impact of passionate educators into learners by inviting them to compete here for the ultimate prize: <em>The Opportunity to Enrich Curious Minds</em></p>

      <h1 className="pure-u-1 centered-text">Let The Competition Begin</h1>
      <p className="pure-u-1"></p>
      <p>The platform measures resources by how well they are engaging students, motivating continued studies, and improving subject comprehension.  The better a lesson performs, the more students it reaches.</p>

      <h1 className="pure-u-1 centered-text"><p>We Can Invert</p><p>The Student:Teacher Ratio</p></h1>
      <p className="pure-u-1">Socratic Combat aims to synthesize educational resources (lessons and their associated quizzes, organized by topics) into an algorithmically generated curriculum personalized for the student so that each student is continuously guided, prompted, and supported by numerous teachers.  As students assess themselves with quizzes, the platform continuously improves itself by identifying which teaching materials are yielding the strongest student performance.</p>

      <h1 className="pure-u-1 centered-text">Empower Curiosity</h1>
      <p className="pure-u-1">Socratic Combat puts students as the central navigators of their educational journey, where the menus of topics, lessons, and quizzes are highlighted with algorithmically measured signals that help guide students towards their own criteria for success.</p>
      <ul className="pure-u-1">
        <li>✅ “Most frequently completed” helps highlight common concepts</li>
        <li>↗️ “Pre-requisite concept” identifies critical building blocks</li>
        <li>🔥 “Strongest motivator of further study” stokes the fire of curiosity</li>
        <li>🕐 “Shortest time to complete” highlights opportunities for quick win</li>
        <li>📈 “Improves future performance” rewards but challenges</li>
      </ul>
