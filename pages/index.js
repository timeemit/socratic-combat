    <h1>Socratic Combat</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Socratic Combat, the education platform where instructors compete to cultivate students, everything is measured, and nothing is assumed.</p>
    <h2>Let The Competition Begin</h2>
    <p>Instructors are competing here for the ultimate prize: the opportunity to enrich curious minds. The platform measures lessons by how well they are engaging students, motivating continued studies, and improving subject comprehension.  The better a lesson performs, the more students it reaches!</p>
    <h2>Inverting the Student:Teacher Ratio</h2>
    <p>Socratic Combat synthesizes educational resources (lessons and their associated quizzes, organized by topics) into an algorithmically generated curriculum personalized for the student.  Each student is continuously guided, prompted, and supported by numerous teachers. While students assess themselves with quizzes, the platform continuously improves itself by attentively identifying which teaching materials are yielding the strongest student performance.</p> 
    <h2>Data-Powered Studies...</h2>
    <p>Socratic Combat puts students as the central navigators of their educational journey, where the menus of topics, lessons, and quizzes are highlighted with algorithmically measured signals that help guide students towards their own criteria for success.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ “Most frequently completed” helps highlight common concepts</li>
      <li>↗️ “Pre-requisite concept” identifies critical building blocks</li>
      <li>🔥 “Strongest motivator of further study” stokes the fire of curiosity</li>
      <li>🕐 “Shortest time to complete” highlights opportunities for quick win</li>
      <li>📈 “Improves future performance” rewards but challenges</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>...of a Data-Driven Teaching Experience</h2>

    <p>At the back of every instructor's mind are doubts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>😴 “Are my students engaged?”</li>
      <li>📉 “How much of an impact have I actually had?”</li>
      <li>🙄 “Have I kindled an ongoing curiosity in my students?”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But with Socratic Combat they can answer these questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>😯 Get precise engagement metrics</p>
        <p>(“92% of the students that saw your lesson completed the quiz”)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>🧐 Quantify your impact on students</p>
        <p>(“Your students are 15% more likely to correctly answer an 8th Grade Algebra question”)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>🤔 Motivate long term learning</p>
        <p>(“Your students are 68% more likely to attempt another 10th Grade Physics lesson”)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Join the Alpha</h2>
    <p>Socratic Combat is an effort to measurably scale the impact of passionate, capable educators into the lives of students of all ages and interests.  As a college graduate that is forever grateful for the profound technical lessons and life advice I received from teachers leading into my career, I am appalled by the inefficiencies and inequities that plague institutions of education across the globe.</p>  
    <p>You are likely viewing this page because I’ve personally reached out to you for your expertise on a subject.  Help me take Socratic Combat from a hopeful idea into a thriving community.  While this isn’t my first rodeo when it comes to building software or companies (my curriculum vitae is here or you can connect with me on LinkedIn), it is my first foray into EdTech, so brutally honest feedback about why you don’t think this will work is welcome. 😎</p>
